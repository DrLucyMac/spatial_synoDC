Spatial localization of myeloid DC and CD4 T cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis synovial tissue

This repository contains notebooks with code for the analysis of CosMx single cell spatial transcriptomics of synovial tissue from active RA and RA in sustained remission. These data are used for the localization of distinct myeloid DC and CD4 T cell populations in synovial tissue. These analyses include cell segmentation, coarse cell type annotation and reference annotation of subclusters using scRNAseq, niche identification and analysis of cell type colocalization.
